# QR-GENERATOR
QR stands for "Quick Response." While they may look simple, QR codes can store lots of data. But no matter how much they contain when scanned, the QR code should allow the user to access information instantly â€“ hence why it's called a Quick Response code.

PURPOSE: It is a 2-D standardized tag that can be carefully scanned by cell phones. QR codes contain data very much like scanner tags. They can be used to settle a decision, communicate something specific or email, or even open a site.
